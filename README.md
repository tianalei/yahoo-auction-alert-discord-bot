# Yahoo Auction and Mercari Discord Bot

# Customize for zhCN & Using Mercari Python API wrapper

```python

nohup python main_zhcn.py

```


# Original version
This project is a Discord bot designed to find newly posted articles on Yahoo Auction and Mercari and alert the user on a Discord server. The bot employs an unofficial Google Translator API to translate the article names from Japanese, which can occasionally result in instability.

## Installation

Before you start the installation process, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This project is compatible with Python 3.8 and above.

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/vlourme/yahoo-auction-alert-discord-bot.git`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlourme/yahoo-auction-alert-discord-bot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd yahoo-auction-alert-discord-bot
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting Up the Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store the Discord token required for the bot to function. The `.env` file should look something like this:

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-token
CHECK_INTERVAL=60
ENABLE_YAHOO_AUCTION=true
ENABLE_MERCARI=true
```

Replace `your-discord-token` with the actual Discord bot token.

## Running the Bot

You can start the bot by running the `main.py` script.

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot should now be running and scanning Yahoo Auction and Mercari for new articles.

## Important Notes

1. The bot depends on an unofficial Google Translator API to translate the names of the articles from Japanese. Due to the unofficial nature of this API, it can be unstable at times. We are working on a more stable solution and appreciate your patience in the interim.

2. This bot also relies on ZenMarket unofficial API to fetch items, any API change could break this bot.

3. Make sure to keep your Discord token secure and never share it with anyone.
